# In this kata, you are given the sum of the number of vertices, edges, and faces of an
# N-sided prism, which is equal to s. Your task is to determine and return a tuple containing four values: the number of vertices, edges,
# faces, and the number of sides of the base of the prism.
# A prism is a polyhedron with two parallel, congruent bases and rectangular lateral faces connecting the corresponding sides of the bases.
# triangular prism example:
# For an N-sided prism:
# Vertices (V): The total number of vertices.
# Edges (E): The total number of edges.
# Faces (F): The total number of faces.
# Base sides (B): The number of sides of the base of the prism.
# Given the sum s = V + E + F return the tuple (V ,E ,F ,B).

# Constraints:
#     1. The number of sides of the base B is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

#     2. The sum s is an integer in the range 4 ≤ 𝑠 ≤ 1000
